## 🎓 Business Logic

### Financial Formula
```
Revenue - Expenses = Net Profit

Where Expenses =
  Fixed Expenses (per branch) +
  Variable Expenses (per branch) +
  Salaries (branch + global employees) +
  Shared Expenses (distributed portion)
```

### Discount Calculation
```
If discountPercent:
  discountAmount = originalPrice * (discountPercent / 100)
  finalPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount

If discountAmount:
  finalPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount
  discountPercent = (discountAmount / originalPrice) * 100
```

### Shared Expense Distribution
```
EQUAL:
  amountPerBranch = totalAmount / numberOfActiveBranches

PROPORTIONAL:
  branchPortion = totalAmount * (branchRevenue / totalRevenue)
```

3. **Email Notifications** - Send alerts for low cash flow, payment reminders
4. **Advanced Reports** - More report types (student progress, employee performance)
5. **Multi-Currency** - Support for international branches
6. **Mobile App** - React Native or Flutter mobile application
7. **ts-rest Integration** - As mentioned, migrate to ts-rest for AWS deployment
8. **Two-Factor Authentication** - Enhanced security
9. **Audit Logs** - Track all changes with user attribution
10. **Backup & Restore** - Automated backup system
