## The Operating System for Multi-Location Service Businesses

A comprehensive **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for managing multi-location service businesses across industries. Track revenue, expenses, clients, employees, and gain real-time financial insights—all from one powerful dashboard.

### 🎯 Our Vision

**Building the Shopify for multi-location service businesses.** We're starting with robotics academies (our validated beachhead market with 3 paying customers), then expanding to all education verticals, and ultimately powering operations for any multi-location business.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (AWS Lambda)

The backend REST API is deployed to AWS Lambda using a personal AWS profile (no SSO required).

#### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI** installed and configured
   ```bash
   # Install AWS CLI (if not already installed)
   # Windows: Download from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   # macOS: brew install awscli
   # Linux: sudo apt-get install awscli
   ```

2. **AWS Personal Profile** configured with access key
   ```bash
   # Configure AWS profile
   aws configure --profile personal

   # You'll be prompted to enter:
   # - AWS Access Key ID
   # - AWS Secret Access Key
   # - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
   # - Default output format (json)
   ```

3. **Serverless Framework** (if using)
   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   ```

#### Deploy Backend

Navigate to your backend/API directory and deploy:

```bash
# Using AWS CLI with personal profile
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name your-api-function-name \
  --zip-file fileb://deployment-package.zip \
  --profile personal

# Or if using Serverless Framework
serverless deploy --aws-profile personal --stage production
```

#### Environment Variables

Make sure to set the required environment variables in AWS Lambda:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your SQL database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token generation
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Secret key for refresh token
- Any other API keys or configuration

#### Database Setup

Ensure your SQL database is accessible from AWS Lambda:
1. If using RDS, configure security groups to allow Lambda access
2. Set up VPC configuration if needed
3. Run database migrations before deploying

#### Verify Deployment

Test your deployed API endpoint:
```bash
# Check API health
curl https://your-api-endpoint.amazonaws.com/health

# Test authentication
curl -X POST https://your-api-endpoint.amazonaws.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@automate-magic.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

### Frontend Deployment

Frontend is not yet hosted. When ready to deploy:
- Update `environment.production.ts` with your production API endpoint
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Deploy to hosting service (AWS S3 + CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## 🔐 Default Credentials

After seeding the database, use these credentials to log in:

- **Admin User:**
  - Email: `admin@automate-magic.com`
  - Password: `admin123`

- **Branch Manager:**
  - Email: `manager@automate-magic.com`
  - Password: `manager123`

## 📊 Financial Calculations

The system calculates net profit using the following formula:

```
Net Profit = Total Revenue - (Fixed Expenses + Variable Expenses + Salaries + Shared Expenses)
```

### Expense Types:
- **Fixed** - Recurring monthly expenses (rent, utilities)
- **Variable** - One-time expenses
- **Shared** - Global expenses distributed across branches (equally or proportionally)

### Revenue Tracking:
Revenues are **automatically generated** from two sources:
- **Course Enrollments** - When students enroll in courses (with support for discounts and installments)
- **Product Sales** - When products are sold

**Important:** You cannot manually create, edit, or delete revenue entries. All revenue is tracked automatically based on enrollments and sales transactions. This ensures accurate financial reporting and prevents manual data entry errors.

**Total Addressable Market:** $4.2B+ across 1 million multi-location service businesses

### Why This Strategy Works

**Beachhead Validation:**
- Start narrow (robotics) to prove product-market fit
- Tight-knit community enables word-of-mouth growth
- Multi-location operators validate core value proposition

**Platform Leverage:**
- 85% of codebase works across all industries
- Only 15% customization needed per vertical

## 📚 Example: Course & Class System (Education Vertical)

The platform uses a flexible **Program-to-Session** model (terminology adapts per industry):

### Programs/Courses
- Templates for offerings (e.g., "Robotics 101", "Piano Lessons", "Yoga Class")
- Define pricing, duration, and default instructor/provider
- Can be offered across multiple locations

### Sessions/Classes
- Specific scheduled instances of a program
- Multiple sessions can run simultaneously or at different times
- Each session has:
  - **Independent scheduling**: Start/end dates, times, days of week
  - **Custom instructor/provider**: Defaults to program instructor
  - **Capacity tracking**: Maximum participants and current enrollment
  - **Unique identifier**: For easy tracking

### Example (Robotics Academy)
"Robotics 101" course with three classes:
- **Class A**: Morning session (9 AM - 11 AM), Mon/Wed, taught by Instructor Smith
- **Class B**: Evening session (5 PM - 7 PM), Tue/Thu, taught by Instructor Jones
- **Class C**: Weekend session (10 AM - 12 PM), Saturdays, taught by Instructor Brown

**This same model adapts to:**
- Music schools (lesson types → individual lessons)
- Fitness studios (class types → scheduled classes)
- Healthcare (service types → appointments)
- Professional services (service packages → consultations)

## 🗂️ Data Storage & Scalability

**SQL Database (PostgreSQL)** provides:
- Reliable and scalable data persistence
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Efficient querying and indexing
- Multi-tenant data isolation with company_id filtering
- Perfect for small businesses to enterprise scale

**Designed to scale:**
- ✅ Handles 1-10 locations per customer
- ✅ Supports 10,000+ customers on shared infrastructure
- ✅ AWS RDS with automatic backups and failover
- ✅ Read replicas for analytics and reporting

Database seed scripts are located in the `data/seed/` directory for initial setup.

## 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security

- **Multi-Tenant Isolation** - Complete data isolation between companies with mandatory company_id filtering
- **JWT-Based Tenant Context** - Company ID embedded in JWT token for secure tenant identification
- **Role-Based Access Control** - ADMIN (company-wide), BRANCH_MANAGER (location-specific), ACCOUNTANT roles
- **Password Security** - Password hashing with bcrypt (industry standard)
- **Token Management** - Secure JWT access and refresh tokens with automatic expiration
- **Request Validation** - All API requests validated for company ownership
- **Database Constraints** - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- **Location-Level Permissions** - Fine-grained access control at location level
- **Audit Logging** - Track all critical operations (coming soon)
- **SOC 2 Compliance Roadmap** - Preparing for enterprise customers

**Industry-Specific Security:**
- Healthcare vertical will include HIPAA compliance

## 🗑️ Delete Confirmation

For safety and data protection, all delete operations in the application require:
- A confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- Users must type **"delete"** (case-sensitive) to confirm the deletion
- This applies to all entities: programs/courses, locations/branches, clients/students, expenses, etc.

This two-step confirmation process ensures that critical data is not accidentally removed.

## 🌍 Industry Adaptability

Our platform terminology automatically adapts to each industry:

| Concept | Robotics Academy | Music School | Fitness Studio | Healthcare Clinic |
|---------|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Locations** | Branches | Locations | Studios | Clinics |
| **Clients** | Students | Students | Members | Patients |
| **Programs** | Courses | Lessons | Classes | Services |
| **Sessions** | Classes | Lessons | Sessions | Appointments |
| **Staff** | Instructors | Teachers | Trainers | Providers |
| **Revenue Source** | Enrollments | Lessons | Memberships | Appointments |

**Same platform. Different language. Infinite possibilities.**
