## 💵 Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

#### Current (Organic/Low Cost)
- Marketing spend: $500/month
- Sales effort: 20 hours/month × $50/hour = $1,000
- **Total monthly cost:** $1,500
- **Customers acquired per month:** 3-5
- **CAC:** $300-500 per customer

#### With Investment (Scaled Marketing)
- Paid ads: $3,000/month
- Content marketing: $1,500/month
- Sales team (part-time): $2,500/month
- **Total monthly cost:** $7,000
- **Expected customers per month:** 6-8
- **CAC:** $875-1,167 per customer

**Target CAC:** $800-1,000

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

- **ARPA:** $300/month
- **Gross Margin:** 85% (typical SaaS)
- **Average Customer Lifetime:** 30 months (assumption)
- **LTV = $300 × 0.85 × 30 = $7,650**

### LTV:CAC Ratio

- **Current:** $7,650 / $400 = **19:1** (excellent, but unsustainable at scale)
- **With investment:** $7,650 / $1,000 = **7.6:1** (excellent)
- **Target:** 3:1 minimum (you exceed this!)

### Payback Period

- **CAC:** $1,000
- **Monthly gross profit:** $300 × 0.85 = $255
- **Payback period:** $1,000 / $255 = **3.9 months** ✅

*Excellent! Under 12 months is considered very good for SaaS*
