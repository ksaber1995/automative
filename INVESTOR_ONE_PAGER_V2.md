# Automate Magic - Investor One-Pager v2.0

**The Operating System for Multi-Location Businesses**

---

## 🎯 The Big Vision

**The Problem:** Small-to-medium multi-location businesses (academies, fitness studios, clinics, retail chains) waste 10-15 hours/week on manual operations, lose 5-10% revenue from poor tracking, and can't scale beyond 3-5 locations without operational chaos.

**The Solution:** Automate Magic is a **horizontal multi-tenant SaaS platform** that provides enterprise-grade operations management (students/clients, revenue tracking, multi-location management, team management, analytics) at SMB pricing.

**Go-to-Market Strategy:** Start with robotics academies (underserved, high-growth), validate product-market fit, then expand to adjacent verticals.
